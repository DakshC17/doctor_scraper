                    Michelle is a caring and compassionate person who has worked in different contexts with clients from a variety of cultural backgrounds and socio-economic contexts. She has been practicing as a psychologist for 13 years in South Africa and more recently in Australia which she now calls home. This worldly perspective allows her to be open minded and accepting of people. She is happy to work with people who are facing a range of life’s challenges within a trauma informed structure. She finds it important to provide a safe space where all thoughts and feelings are considered valid and can be expressed. She works together with a client to process feelings and to develop self-insight and understanding. When you see Michelle she will meet with you and explore the concerns that brought you for therapy, the context of these concerns, as well as the goals you would like therapy to address. Michelle enjoys working with adults and finds it rewarding as they make progress.

                    Jeremy is a psychologist who works hard to understand his clients’ experiences deeply – who his clients are as people, why there are experiencing the struggles they face in their lives and how their minds work. He believes that a deep understanding of his clients is key to helping them address their challenges effectively. Jeremy also believes strongly that fostering a deep and safe relationship is the other key to allowing his clients to explore these aspects of their lives with him. He is warm, compassionate and patient in his approach.

                   <p>
                    Jeremy has a Master of Clinical Psychology, and a Bachelor of Nursing. Prior to becoming a psychologist, Jeremy was a Registered Nurse for more than a decade, working in both hospital and community mental health settings. He was involved in coordinating and delivering services to clients with complex needs. As a result, he brings a wealth of experience working with people who have experienced trauma, complex mental health issues and personality disorders.

                   <p>
                    Jeremy is happy to work with adult clients with diverse backgrounds (i.e., different cultures, sexualities, gender identities, religious inclinations etc.). He is keen to help his clients address issues pertaining to their own sense of self (e.g., mood issues such as depression, anxiety etc.) and also issues pertaining to their relationships with others in their lives now and in the past.

                    Atholl is passionate about creating a safe and supportive connection with clients as the basis for therapeutic work. His approach is warm and gentle and his goals in working with clients are to help them to understand their deeper needs and to facilitate growth toward the life they want to be living. Appreciating, celebrating, and encouraging diversity is an important part of this process (including LGBTIQ+ and neurodiversity).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Atholl views life as a journey of growth and self-discovery that leads not only to a meaningful life but also to a greater capacity to contribute to others’ lives in constructive and meaningful ways. Getting stuck somewhere along that journey can lead to difficult emotional experiences (such as depression, anxiety or anger) and to difficulty in finding satisfaction in relationships with others. He also enjoys supporting people in navigating life changes (relationship, family, work, health) and shifts in identity.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He is skilled in facilitating clients to feel heard and understood and comes to psychology with a diverse range of life experiences. He has worked in a range of contexts including government, not-for-profit and private practice organisations, providing education, leadership, crisis support and short- and longer-term therapeutic care. He has also undertaken extensive research exploring men’s experiences of intimacy.

                    Eugene has always been curious about looking beyond the surface of a person even as a child.  This contrasts sharply with the notion of “Face” placed in the Asian culture he has grown up in.  He wants to know the person behind the “Face” – what drives them, what motivates them, how they overcome their problems.    This curiosity drove Eugene to become a psychologist, to look for depth in the human experience.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Eugene is also fascinated with different cultures and the uniquely different ideas that come from these cultures.  He has lived in many places and exposed himself to different people.  These included: living in China (Sichuan province); staying in England where he worked with disabled and homeless people, and more recently, working as a psychologist in Australia.  These experiences have broadened Eugene’s understanding of people, and made him even more open-minded.  These encounters have also exposed Eugene to the experience of being a cultural minority in a new country, placing him in a unique position to help other migrants.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Eugene uses a variety to psychological techniques to help his clients.  He uses a humanistic  and psychodynamic approach when applying these techniques.  This means that he respects the person behind their mental health symptoms.

At the initial appointment, Chaminga will review your history and what reports and assessments are needed.  An estimate will be provided for the cost to do the assessments and generate the report after the initial appointment.  Full payment will be required prior to release of any assessment or report.

                    Georgia is a Provisional Psychologist who is currently in the penultimate year of her Doctor of Psychology (Clinical Psychology and Clinical Neuropsychology) at the University of Queensland. During her placements, she has gained experience in a broad range of mental health concerns from a psychological and neuropsychological perspective, in particular in the areas of anxiety, brain injury, trauma and PTSD, depression, grief, and adjustment to change.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Georgia is a gentle, compassionate, and non-judgemental psychologist who greatly values the therapeutic relationship as a key part of connecting with clients and delivering outcomes. She utilises her understanding of neuroscience alongside psychology to help build a safe, trusting, and collaborative space for her clients to self-reflect and better understand their concerns and themselves. Georgia is passionate about considering the whole life story and picture of the client seeking therapy to ensure that therapy is holistic and well-suited to the individual. Ultimately, Georgia is a keen advocate for her clients and understands the importance of building purpose and meaning in order to create lasting change, and is not afraid of bringing some humour into the conversation. In her spare time, she enjoys reading, painting/sketching, and spending time with her friends and family.

                    Cherie is a trauma-informed registered psychologist with a Master of Clinical Psychology. She brings experience from working in the hospital, private practice, organisational, and high school settings. As a therapist, Cherie is a warm and non-judgmental listener who aims to provide each client with a therapeutic relationship where they can truly experience their genuine self, leading to a deeper understanding of themselves and their experiences.

                    Cherie embraces a holistic approach, drawing from a range of evidence-based methods tailored to each client’s unique needs and goals.

This understanding forms the foundation of her approach, helping clients break free from past patterns and opening up new, more fulfilling ways of relating to themselves and others. Cherie has a special interest in working with adults who have a history of complex childhood trauma, sexual abuse recovery, personality vulnerabilities, perinatal mental health, and women’s sexual health issues.
